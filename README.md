# Custom Enchants Skript

This is a Skript for Minecraft!

**Requires Skript:**

https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript

This Skript adds a GUI with multiple menus inside. Here are some of the features you will find:

# Purchasable Pickaxes:
Purchasable pickaxes are among the many items available in this GUI! These pickaxes are the only ones that will receive enchantments. The currency being used is already set, but feel free to change it to whatever you need.

# Custom Enchants:
As the Skript is named, you will discover a variety of custom enchants, one of which is Xp-Finder. These enchants are designed for servers with an economy, as one of the new enchants has a chance of granting a custom currency. I will provide a fully customizable shop using that currency, and possibly more in the future. If you do not want a custom currency, feel free to delete it, as all enchants are marked in the Skript.

# Settings:
Something most of you may not have seen before: Settings! This feature provides options like the iconic 'Dark Mode' and many others that may be added in the future.

# More Coming Soon!
This Skript is currently in development, so be prepared for future updates.

# Disclaimer!

This Skript may or may not be currently functioning correctly. If it is, I plan to revamp it soon to enhance usability and cleanliness.
